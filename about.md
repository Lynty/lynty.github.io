# About

## besides the stuff about me to the left

💀 I like tattoos<br>
🐈‍⬛ I've been described as having a personality like a cat... make of that what you will<br>
🌱 I can barely take care of anything but I have some plants that survived well past the covid period<br>

🏄🏻‍♀️ snowboarding and dancing are my main things but I also enjoy horseback riding, surfing, rock climbing, yoga, tackle football, tennis, hiking, strength training, wakeboarding, paddleboarding, I could go on forever<br>

## actually this would be a lot easier if I just mentioned the things that I don't like

🥕 vegetables (especially carrots)<br>
🎲 most board games<br>
💧 drinking (water, soda, alcohol, etc)<br>
🍔 not having enough to eat<br>
🤥 liars<br>
⏳ waiting<br>
