COVID has been around for a couple years now and the novelty of having my boyfriend as my home-office-mate has long wore off. What happens when you put an extroverted coworker who talks a lot in meetings throughout the day with an introverted coworker struggling with inattentive ADHD in the same room, no more than 6 feet apart?

What happens is: the introverted coworker builds her own office in the backyard! ðŸ˜‚ (with a bunch of help from her extroverted coworker)
