## TIL

### Solidity Prechecks
Holy guacamole. I was about to compile my own checklist of things you should check before deploying a smart contract but remembered someone probably has already done this. They certainly <a href="https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/ethereum-smart-contract-audit-checklist-ba9d1159b901" target="_blank">did</a>; but what I wasn't expecting was 29 issues to check for! As of May 2019, the multitude of issues were spread across 5 categories:

1. Coding Specification Issues
1. Design Defect Issues
1. Coding Security Issues
1. Coding Design Issues
1. Coding Hidden Danger Issues

The fact that your smart contract must be perfect on your first try terrifies me. You're literally deploying straight to production and there's no turning back! If you have some overlooked security flaw or unoptimized math operation(s) in your code; that's money lost to yourself and/or the users! Immutability is a double edged sword.

### Metaverse
The virtual reality universe in *Ready Player One* is already here via the Metaverse.
  - Nike sells virtual Jordanâ€™s in Fortnite
  - various platforms accept crypto as a payment option for virtual goods including VR-based real estate
  - gamers within Decentraland and <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" target="_blank">The Sandbox </a> can create virtual businesses such as casinos and theme parks, then monetize them

I strongly considered downloading The Sandbox and trying it out. But I'm gonna try and delay my gaming relapse; I've got Solidity to study!

## General

I wonder if I'd be any good as a solutions architect? I imagine it would be pretty different from my current role. Do you get to engineer *more* potentially? Because the way I see it, you would need to architect a solution and the only way to make sure it's valid is by proof-of-concepting it out yourself. That's exactly what I would want to do. I'd love to spend my days building cool things and playing around with new technology. Most of my current days are spent asking for various permissions, gathering information, repeating myself multiple times to various people, and fixing others' tech debt. Yay.
