It's a new year! And I haven't updated the site in a bit.

## TIL
I spent this morning's <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">deep work</a>
 session studying networking. You're probably thinking "what?? how in this point in your career are you barely studying networking?" The goal here is to get three certifications in a single day because at this point, one is no longer enough for me. So I'll get 3 "easy" ones. "Easy" as in, I should already know this and I shouldn't have to spend a considerable amount of time preparing. The three certifications I'll be going for are: 

 1. GCP Professional Cloud Network Engineer
 1. GCP Cloud Digital Leader
 1. HashiCorp Terraform Associate

I thought the Google Cloud Certified Anthos Fellow would be the final cert, but nope. I strive in conditions where I put myself in unfamiliar territory and am near my limit with challenging goals; which leads me to my general update...

## General

I have some career goals I want to achieve by end of Q1 2022:

- [ ] Pass 3 certifications in a single day
- [ ] Decide how I want to lead, practice by doing, and get promoted to Associate Manager / Staff Cloud Engineer
- [ ] Share knowledge while dedicating time to build my brand through engineering articles, this website, internal company demonstrations, etc
- [ ] Successfully lead a team in migrating a client from AWS to GCP
- [ ] Organize and moderate a meeting on an internal company initiative

Why? I want to see what I can achieve and I want to see what I'm capable of. I've truly started from nothing and if I can continue to grow far beyond what I thought my limits were, maybe I can inspire others through leading by example. And if I didn't accomplish influencing a single person in my lifetime, at least I'll know I constantly dared myself to try.
