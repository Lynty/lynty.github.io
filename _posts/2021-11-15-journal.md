## TIL
I spent this morning's <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">deep work</a>
 session studying more Solidity.

### Solidity

Today's session was pretty difficult. I'm at the point where things start to move faster and are harder to grasp. It's where I think most beginners give up. 

> If it's easy, you're not learning.

- get the smart contract we are developing funded (nothing is free y'all)
- import an external npm package (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts" target="_blank">chainlink</a>) to use their smart contract(s)
  - convert ether to USD using <a href="https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price/" target="_blank">chainlink data feed</a>
  - we need a data feed because blockchain can't use API calls (oracle problem)
- we need to pay the smart contract that is offering us the price feed service (once again, nothing is free)
  - find the address for the network and currency pair
  - <a href="https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/#Rinkeby%20Testnet" target="_blank">Rinkeby: ETH -> USD</a>
- decimals don't work in solidity
  - not every machine used by every miner is guaranteed to implement the same floating-point standard
  - math is done entirely using fixed-point arithmetic

Here's what I have so far; it's unfinished code because there was too much to take in at too quick of a pace. I needed to stop and process before moving forward:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT 

solidity >=0.6.6 <0.9.0;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract FundMe {
    
    mapping(address => uint256) public addressToAmountFunded;
    
    function fund() public payable {
        addressToAmountFunded[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        // ETH -> USD conversion rate
    }
    
    function getVersion() public view returns (uint256) {
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x8A753747A1Fa494EC906cE90E9f37563A8AF630e);
        return priceFeed.version();
    }
    
    function getPrice() public view returns(uint256) {
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x8A753747A1Fa494EC906cE90E9f37563A8AF630e);
        (,int256 answer,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        return uint256(answer * 10000000000); // return in Wei
    }
}
```

### EOSIO

I learned a bit about the EOSIO blockchain platform over the weekend.
- using **delegated** proof of stake
  - 21 block producers with 32 on standby
- apparently the most performant?
  - The <a href="https://training.eos.io/" target="_blank">resource</a> I used for my learning was straight from EOSIO so they're probably biased
- you can upgrade your smart contract?! 
  - I'm doing a non-technical course so they don't go into detail on how this is possible
  - investigation for another time
- no transaction cost!
  - I'm guessing the block producers get all their money from block rewards but besides the original 21, what's the incentive for everyone else running in the network? ðŸ¤”
  - also investigation for another time

## General

I've been allocating too much time on learning Blockchain that I've fallen a bit behind on work. Everything requires such a delicate balance. I don't do balance though. I'll just go all-in on work momentarily and crank out a bunch of items. Then I can go back to all-in on blockchain studies!
