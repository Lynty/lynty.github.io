## Advent of Code

What better way is there for learning and practicing Go than to use it as the language of choice for <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/about" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a>? I've only spent ~3 hours of deep work sessions studying Go but I found that it was enough to at least complete the first two days of the advent calendar!

## Airing of the Grievances

I had a meeting at work today that was labeled "Airing of the grievances". Boy did we air the grief! I won't go into the details of the numerous issues the team brought up but the outcome left me feeling hopeful. I feel like a valued member in the group and I truly believe upper management is listening and taking action. While the past couple months haven't been the greatest as far as work is concerned, the trajectory has sharply privoted upwards! The plan is to transition me off the project sometime in January or February of 2022. I'll finally be able to execute on the exciting ideas I have and get to do the things I want and love to do!
