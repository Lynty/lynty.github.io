## General
2.5 months to complete my last 2 goals? Hell yes. What a hectic whirlwind these last couple of months have been! I meant to take my foot off the gas pedal just a bit after finishing my AWS to GCP migration project but I ended up pedaling to the metal. Is there a risk of burn out? Absolutely. But I don't know how to **not** overwhelm myself with challenges and opportunities.

I'll be honing in on completing my last couple of goals for the rest of this month. There will be less journals and personal goal progress and more technical content. I promise!
