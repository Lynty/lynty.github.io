## TIL
I spent this morning's <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">deep work</a>
 session working on the <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/" target="_blank">cryptozombies</a> courses. I finished creating the app and I'm currently on the last course which deals with creating a basic web page where users can interact with it! Here are my main takeaways so far: <!--TOPIC-->

### 1. ERC20 and ERC721 Tokens
- ERC20 = tokens that act like currency
- ERC721 = tokens that are like collectibles (NFTs)

### 2. Overflows & Underflows
- `uint8` = `2^8` = `256` = max value
- overflow
```solidity
uint8 var = 256;
var = var + 1 // 256 + 1 = 0 due to hitting max value
```
- underflow
```solidity
uint8 var = 0;
var = var - 1 // 0 - 1 = 256 due to hitting min value
```
- best practice is to use the <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/math" target="_blank">SafeMath library</a> that provides overflow checks and reverts transactions when it occurs

### 3. NatSpec Format
- Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format
- special form of comments in Solidity contracts that provide rich documentation
- example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.6;

/// @title A simulator for trees
/// @author Larry A. Gardner
/// @notice You can use this contract for only the most basic simulation
/// @dev All function calls are currently implemented without side effects
contract Tree {
    /// @author Mary A. Botanist
    /// @notice Calculate tree age in years, rounded up, for live trees
    /// @dev The Alexandr N. Tetearing algorithm could increase precision
    /// @param rings The number of rings from dendrochronological sample
    /// @return age in years, rounded up for partial years
    function age(uint256 rings) external pure returns (uint256) {
        return rings + 1;
    }
}
```

## General

I mostly worked on boring persistent volume replication documentation today. I'm in desperate need of a change of pace at work. Thanksgiving is tomorrow! I'm thankful for my career and my relationships. Maybe a four day weekend will be enough to reignite the flame that sizzled out. Have a great weekend!
