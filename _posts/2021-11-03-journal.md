## TIL
I spent this morning's <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank">deep work</a> session learning about blockchain technology. Here are the 5 main things I took away:

**1. Interplanetary File System (IPFS)**
- content addressing vs location addressing
- very similar to how BitTorrent works
- no need for a central CA / SSL if whole sites could live in client's browser

**2. Meridio Extrinsic Token**
- real estate property = set of tokens which are distributed to investors
- an investor selling their token is selling their share of the property

**3. Crypto Cities**
- it would be cool to live in a crypto city built from scratch
- Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum) has a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/10/31/cities.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> that dives into its potential and provides better information than I ever could (btw I'm a fangirl of Vitalik after doing 1 hour of research on him, yes that's all it takes)

**4. Ethereum 2.0**
- proof of stake and sharding
- hard fork upgrade
    - hard fork = old and new blockchains exist side by side
    - soft fork = only one blockchain will remain valid after update

**5. Craig Wright**
- Trump-like figure in the Blockchain community
- claims to be the anonymous founder of Bitcoin (Satoshi Nakamoto)

## General

The day flew by setting up the foundations for this website. It's one of those things where you spend so much time and have little to show for it. But now with the skeleton configured and a general understanding of jekyll, liquid, and a bit of css; I can hopefully begin to post regularly with little effort and time ðŸ˜Š
