**stress!**

Deciding to go for the Google Certified Anthos Fellowship was probably one of my craziest ideas of the year. It requires being able to demonstrate leadership, business, and technical accumen on Anthos. I felt largely unqualified.

I had my Google panel interview on October 19th and won't get results back until the end of this month.

**post mortem**
- leadership
    - I wish I had led the leadership questions (how meta). I had adequately prepared stories ahead of time where I could and have demonstrated thought leadership, mentored others, and led technical projects but somehow; the 20 minutes I had to show my ability to lead passed quickly and the line of questioning prevented me from communicating the stories I wanted to share.
- business
    - I think I was able to answer everything here. My only worry is that I might've sounded repetitive. Maybe "talking business" means being able to communicate the same solutions for the same problems in various creative ways.
- technical
    - I over prepared for this by creating both a presentation deck and a 19 page technical design document (TDD). Despite all the time I put into architecting a solution and ensuring there weren't any holes in my design; I still don't feel super confident, but when do I ever feel that way?

There's a lot more to post on this topic but I'm currently still of the mindset glad-its-over-with-lets-not-think-about-it-until-later-when-results-come-back ðŸ˜‚

**To be continued!**
